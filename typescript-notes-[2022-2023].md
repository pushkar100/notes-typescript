## Introduction

- Superset of JS
- Allows use of strict types: (Benefit = less errors)
- Modern ES6+ features supported (Arrow functions, let, const) (Uses a babel-like compiler internally)
- Extra features on top of ES6+ (Interfaces, Generics, Tuples, etc)

TS has utilities to build JS for the web (since only JS runs) that supports everything above. 
- TS does not execute in a browser
- TS comes with a powerful compiler that compiles the code into JS which can then run in the browser
- Features compiled to JS are "workarounds" and any possible errors are thrown by the compiler

Example of a need for TS:
* Consider a function for adding two numbers
* If we pass it two strings instead, it performs string concatenation instead of addition
* This is a logical error as the original function never meant to concatenate strings
* With types, we can catch such errors at build or compile time using a tool such as TS i.e write better code

***Installation***: `npm i -g typescript`. This command installs the TS compiler (globally) which provides us with a `tsc` command.

***Compilation***: `tsc sandbox.ts` where sandbox.ts is the typescript file to be compiled. The corresponding JS file `sandbox.js` will be output (***writes to it, creates one if it does not exist***)

***Compile with a watcher***: `tsc sandbox.ts -w` where `-w` watches for any changes to the files and automatically re-builds the JS for it

Example:
```ts
// using-ts.ts
const button = document.querySelector("button")! as HTMLButtonElement;
const input1 = document.getElementById("num1")! as HTMLInputElement;
const input2 = document.getElementById("num2")! as HTMLInputElement;

function add(num1: number, num2: number) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

button.addEventListener("click", function() {
  console.log(add(+input1.value, +input2.value));
});
```
The compiled output in JS will be (`tsc using-ts.ts`):
```js
const button = document.querySelector("button")! as HTMLButtonElement;
const input1 = document.getElementById("num1")! as HTMLInputElement;
const input2 = document.getElementById("num2")! as HTMLInputElement;

function add(num1: number, num2: number) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

button.addEventListener("click", function() {
  console.log(add(+input1.value, +input2.value));
});
```

If in case there is an error, TS will complain in the terminal (& editor if the plugin is enabled) like so.
```
(base) âžœ  adjusted-project tsc using-ts.ts
using-ts.ts:10:19 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.

10   console.log(add(input1.value, +input2.value));
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~

Found 1 error in using-ts.ts:10
```
However, *TS will always output the JS, even in cases where there is an error!*

*TypeScript forces us to write cleaner, better, and less error-prone code.*

### Advantages of using TypeScript

TS adds:
- Types: You need to be explicit about what you want and avoid unnecessary behaviour
- Next-gen JS features: Compiles it down to JS that works on older browsers just like what a tool like Babel can do
- Non-JS features like Interfaces or Generics: These cannot be compiled into JS but still help you write better code (will be checked and removed during compilation)
- Meta-programming features like Decorators
- Rich config options (`tsconfig.json`)
- Modern tooling that helps even in non-TS projects

## Data types

***The following are data types in JS that are also types in TS!***
1. Number (`number`). Ex `0`, `1.1`, `1.234`
2. String (`string`). Ex: `"Hi"`, `'hello there'`
3. Boolean (`boolean`). Ex: `true`, `false`
4. Object (`object` or `{}`). Ex: `{}`. `{ a: 10, foo: 'Hey' }`
5. Arrays (`array` or `[]`): Ex: `[1, 2, 3]`, `["Jim", "Tom"]`
6. `undefined`: TS uses this type a bit differently than JS does

In JavaScript, we use the `typeof` operator to read the type of a value or an expression. With TS, however, we use type annotations to read the same.

Type annotations v/s `typeof` operator:
* Annotations in TS are checked at compile time
* `typeof` checks the type of the value at runtime i.e when the JS code is executing in an environment, like the browser.

***Data types in TS that are not valid in JS!***
1. Tuples (`[type1, type2, ...]`): These are fixed-length arrays!
2. Enums (`{ VAL1, VAL2, ...]`): Automatically enumerated global constant identifiers!
3. Any (`any`): Least specific type of assignment. Can assign any type of value to such a type.
4. Union types (`|`): Combines two types i.e allows either one of the combined types
5. Literal type: The type is limited to a single value. Ex: type is the number `5` instead of the set of all numbers
6. Unknown (`unknown`): Similar to any but more restrictive. Needs type checking before it can be used i.e assigned to something else
7. Void (`void`): A special return type of a function when it returns nothing (Implicit return)
8. Never (`never`): Another special return type of a function

### Type annotations

Expected data types for assignments, i.e variables and parameters, can be denoted using the `: <type>` suffix as shown below:
```ts
// Examples:
const x: number = 10;
function add(n1: number, n2: number) { /*...*/ }
function print(word: string) { /*...*/ }
function logIfNecessary(shouldLog: boolean) { /*...*/ }
```

All the special syntax introduced by TS (such as these type annotations) are removed in the generated JS.

### Type inference

We *do not* have to be explicit about the type for every declaration!

TS is smart enough to ***infer*** the types in many cases based on the value being assigned to a variable.

Ex:
```ts
const num: number = 5;
// is equivalent to:
const num = 5;
```
If you hover over it in VSCode, the type will appear.

*Utilise inference whenever possible.*  It is a good practice which:
* Allows TS to calculate the type 
* Reduces redundancy in code

#### When is it good to explicitly set the type?

We should set the type when the *declaration* of a variable & its *assignment* happen separately. An example is that of a `let` variable that is assigned later.

```ts
// Use inference:
const a = 5;

// Define a type explicitly (skip inference):
let b: string;
// ... later in the code:
b = document.getElementByClass('.btn').innerHTML;
```

Without an assignment or a type declaration, TS will assign an `any` type to the variable;

```ts
let a; // "any" type
```

### JS pattern that is a TS anti-pattern

Type checking using `typeof` operator i.e adding a guard clause or performing duck-typing is not required in TS because of the use of type annotations that the compiler checks at build time.

```ts
function add(n1: number, n2: number) {
  // The following runtime check is unnecessary in TS 
  // because we already expect numbers (checked at compile time):
  if (typeof n1 === 'number' && typeof n2 === 'number') {
    // function logic:
    return n1 + n2;
  }
}
```

### The undefined type

This type `undefined` is special in JS. It denotes that a value has been declared but not assigned.

```js
let x; // JS value of `x` is undefined
```

In JS, returning nothing from a function returns `undefined` as well!
```js
const foo = () => {}
foo(); // Returns `undefined` in JS
```

In TS, however, `undefined` can be used as a type, BUT:
* A declared but unassigned value is type `any`
* Be explicit if you want an `undefined` type.
```ts
let x; // `any` type
let y: undefined; // `undefined` type
```
* When a function returns nothing, its type is **`void`** (Not `undefined`). However, the generated JS that runs will return `undefined`. This is a subtle but important difference between JS & TS. 

### Object types

* Object types are also inferred during declaration with assignment
```ts
const user = {
  name: 'Jim',
  age: 25
}
```
The inferred type:
```ts
const user: {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}
```
Note that the key-values are `property: type` in the object type and we semicolons `;` delimit them.

* The `object` type is the *least specific* object type in TS. Generally, more specific types are needed to validate the props
```ts
const user: {} = { // Alternate syntax: `const user: object = {`
  name: 'Jim',
  age: 25
}

console.log(user.name) // ERROR! since the type `object` or `{}` has no properties
```

* Nested objects can also have types defined.
```ts
const user = {
  name: 'Jim',
  age: 25,
  friends: ['Tim', 'Pim', 'Dim'],
  address: {
    house: '2 robert place',
    street: 'highway 14',
    city: 'London'
  }
}

// Type for the object above:
const user: {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    friends: string[];
    address: {
        house: string;
        street: string;
        city: string;
    };
}
```

### Array types

* Array types are defined using the `<elementType>[]` syntax
```ts
let names: string[]; // Defines a type of an array of string type elements

// Alternate syntax:
const names: Array<string>;
```

* Array types can also be inferred!
```ts
const friends = ['Tim', 'Pim', 'Dim'];

// TS type for the above object:
const friends: string[]
```

* TS is smart enough to infer the type of the array items as well! This is great for providing auto-completion through intellisense.
```ts
const friends = ['Tim', 'Pim', 'Dim'];
for(const friend of friends) {
  console.log('Hello, ' + friend.toUpperCase()); // `.toUpperCase()` - No error, auto suggested by TS enabled editor
}
```

* Mixed element types are recognized and inferred by TS. The `|` symbol is used as the union of types i.e mixed element types can be thought of as a union
```ts
const arr = [1, 'Ram']; // Inferred as (number | string)[]
```

### Tuple data type

Tuples are fixed-length arrays!

* Tuples are identified by a special syntax
```ts
// Ex:
[number, string]
```

* Usually tuples have to be identified ***explicitly*** (In order to avoid being confused with an array)
```ts
const ageAndName = [28, 'Rashmi'];
// Inferred as `(string | number)[]` which is a mixed-array and not a tuple

// Be explicit if you need a tuple:
const ageAndName: [number, string] = [28, 'Rashmi'];
```

* Element type mismatch or tuple length mismatch errors are recognized!
```ts
const foo: [number, string] = [28, true]; // ERROR!
const bar: [number, string] = [28, 'Rashmi', 'additionalElement']; // ERROR!
```

* ***TS drawback***: It cannot handle errors with `.push()` (When you push an element, it gets added to the tuple but this operation should ideally not be possible since a tuple is a fixed-length array!)
```ts
const ageAndName: [number, string] = [28, 'Rashmi'];
ageAndName.push('something'); // ALLOWED but should be a type error :/
```

### Enums

Enums are data types that are useful for generating human readable identifiers that internally map to other values.

For example, if you want to provide admin privileges via code and the levels are 1-4 then remembering what 1 as a level is or what 4 is difficult.

One approach can be to set string values like so:
```ts
// ...
{
	role: 'SUPER_USER_ROLE';
}
// ...
if (role === 'SUPER_USER_ROLE') { ... }
```
However, strings can be mistyped and difficult to remember! On top of this, we might want the role to be a number internally (Like `1`)

TS makes it easy to provide such identifiers with their values using `enum`

**Syntax:**
```ts
enum EnumName { ENUM_VALUE_1, ENUM_VALUE_2, ... }
// convention: PascalCase
```

**Usage:**
The enum can be referenced like you would reference an object and its key. Hence, it can be used in your if conditionals, assignments and so on! (Internally, the generated JS for an enum is basically an object!)
```ts
EnumName.ENUM_VALUE_1 // Referencing an enum
```

Example:
```ts
enum Role { ADMIN, USER, READ_ONLY };

const person = {
  name: 'Pushkar',
  role: Role.ADMIN // references an enum
}

if (person.role === Role.USER) { // enum values can be used in conditionals too!
  console.log('You are a user');
}
```
The generated JS file looks like:
```js
var Role;
(function (Role) {
    Role[Role["ADMIN"] = 0] = "ADMIN";
    Role[Role["USER"] = 1] = "USER";
    Role[Role["READ_ONLY"] = 2] = "READ_ONLY";
})(Role || (Role = {}));
;
var person = {
    name: 'Pushkar',
    role: Role.ADMIN // references an enum
};
if (person.role === Role.USER) { // enum values can be used in conditionals too!
    console.log('You are a user');
}
```

**Note:**
* The default internal values for each enum starts with a `0` and increments by 1 for each new enum (Left to right)
* You can *explicitly set the internal values* for an enum using the `=` operator (Some values are not allowed like objects and boolean)
```ts
enum Role { ADMIN = 5, USER = "Hello", READ_ONLY = 'blah' };
```
Generated JS:
```js
var Role;
(function (Role) {
    Role[Role["ADMIN"] = 5] = "ADMIN";
    Role["USER"] = "Hello";
    Role["READ_ONLY"] = "blah";
})(Role || (Role = {}));
;
```

As a user, you are not expected to remember the internal values i.e the mapping between the identifier and the value.

### Any type

It is the least specific type or ***most flexible*** in TS. When you declare a variable but do no assign it a value immediately, or if you don't explicitly declare the type then `any` is what gets assigned.

```ts
let x; // `any` type
```
Do not use `any` if you know what type to expect from a value. It is not a very helpful type and we can perform fewer type checks on it.

One place we can use it is when we expect value whose type is known only at *runtime*. Ex: a data point from a server response. In such a case, you can combine `any` with a JS use guard clauses / `typeof` operator.

**Note**: We can assign an `any` type value to other variables or params that require a specific type and we will NOT have errors as `any` is a flexible type. Think of it as being almost as good as turning off type checking.

### Union types

The union `|` operator allows us to combine types. It is a useful feature when you want to allow more than one core type.

**Syntax**: `type1 | type2 | ... ;`

```ts
let x: number | string = 5; // allowed
let y: number | string = 'Hola!'; // allowed
let z: number | string = true; // ERROR!
```

Sometimes, TS cannot guarantee not running into errors when dealing with union types. In such a case, rely on runtime checks.
Ex:
```ts
const add = (a: number | string, b: number | string) => {
  return a + b; // TS ERROR!
  // Cannot understand that we can concatenate number/string union type
}

// Solution: NO ERROR! (runtime checks)
const add = (a: number | string, b: number | string) => {
  if (typeof a === 'number' && typeof b === 'number') 
    return a + b;
  else if (typeof a === 'string' && typeof b === 'string') 
    return a + b;
}
```

### Literal types

A literal type is ONE value instead of the whole set of values that form a type. 

Ex: 
```ts
let x: 5 = 5; // The type is also 5 - Not a number
x = 6; // ERROR!!
```

When are literal types useful? They are useful when you want to *set some identifiers*.
```ts
const add = (a: number, b: number, resultType: 'print' | 'return') => {
  if (resultType === 'print') {
    console.log(a + b);
    return;
  }

  return a + b;
}
```
`resultType` has a union type of two literal types, `'print'` and `'return'`. An invocation such as `add(1, 2, 'blah')` will fail the type check.

When you need more values for identifiers, it is better to go with an `enum`!

Literal types can also be inferred by TS.

### Unknown type

Holds any value like `any` but is more restrictive. It is not used when you want flexibility like `any` i.e TS will throw errors during assignments to other variables and so on.

Use it when you are unsure of what the value will be but if we can be certain of it *through type checking* then we can perform operations on it i.e type resolution has occurred. Cannot assign an `unknown` value to a known value (But, any is fine)

Ex:
```ts
let foo; // any type
let bar: string;

foo = 5;
bar = foo; // NO ERROR

// -------

let foo: unknown;
let bar: string;

foo = 5;
bar = foo; // ERROR!!
// Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'string'
```
With type resolution:
```ts
let foo: unknown;
let bar: string;

if (typeof foo === 'string') {
  bar = foo; // NO ERROR post resolution
}
```

Bottomline: `unknown` needs extra type checking before use.

### Type aliases

We can create type aliases in order to:
* Have a centralized place to manage a particular type from
* Avoid redundancy i.e You can use the alias name as a placeholder for the type it references (reusability)

**Syntax:** Use the `type` keyword 
```ts
// convention: PascalCase
type ResultType = 'print' | 'return';

type Role = 'admin' | 'user';

type User = {
  name: string,
  age: number,
  role: Role
}

const printUserDetails = (user: User, resultType: ResultType) => {
  /* ... */
}

const getUserRole = ({ role }: User) => { // Type aliases are reusable!
  /* ... */
}
```

## Functions

Functions can be written like they are in JS i.e they are the same in TS but with type annotations:
* Parameters can be given a type
```ts
function add(n1: number, n2: number) {
  /* ... */
}
```
* Return types can be inferred (Let TS do this; recommended)
```ts
function add(n1: number, n2: number) {
  return n1 + n2
}
// TYPE: function add(n1: number,  n2: number): number
```
* Return types can be set explicitly (use `:` after the arguments list)
```ts
function add(n1: number, n2: number): number {
  return n1 + n2
}
```

### Void versus undefined return type

Functions in TS that do NOT return a value i.e implicit return have the `void` return type
```ts
function foo(n1: number, n2: number) {}
// TYPE: function foo(n1: number, n2: number): void
```

Functions in TS that return an empty value i.e explicit `return undefined;` have the `undefined` return type
```ts
function foo(n1: number, n2: number) {
  return undefined;
}
// TYPE: function foo(n1: number, n2: number): undefined
```

### Functions as types

Functions in JS are *first-class objects* i.e they can be passed around as arguments to other functions, assigned to variables, etc.

* TS provides a `Function` type to describe them
```ts
function add(n1: number, n2: number) {
  return n1 + n2;
}

let newAdd: Function;

newAdd = add;
newAdd(1, 2); // 3 (AS EXPECTED)

newAdd = () => {}; // Random function
newAdd(5, 10); // No output (NOT EXPECTED!!)
// Need a more specific type definition!
```
* It is more useful to provide more specific function types!
```ts
function add(n1: number, n2: number) {
  return n1 + n2;
}

// More specific function type! 
let newAdd: (a: number, b: number) => number;

newAdd = add;
newAdd(1, 2); // 3 (AS EXPECTED)

newAdd = () => {}; // ERROR! for function type mismatches!!
```
* Callbacks can also be given a function type but the return type is not really checked! *Ignored intentionally*
```ts
type Adder = (a: number, b: number) => void;

function doSomething(x: number, cb: Adder) {
  cb(x, 10);
}

doSomething(
  5, 
  (a, b) => {
    return a + b; // Even though we return a vlaue, it is ignored by the invoking fn.
    // Hence, passes check.
    // But, params to the callback are strictly checked!!
  }
)
```

### Never type

`never` is a newer type: It is seen only as a function return type like `void`. It is also a rare occurrence.

There are two cases in which the return type of a function can be `never`:
1. When the function throws an error (& never returns)
2. When the function never stops executing i.e infinite loop (& hence never returns)
In both these cases, it is appropriate to assign a `never` return type to the function.
**Note**: `never` was added later to TS as a type and TS does NOT infer the type i.e it defaults to `void` still. Explicitly define this return type.
```ts
function foo(msg: string): never {
  throw new Error(msg);
}

// ---

function foo(msg: string) { // Inferred as `void`
  throw new Error(msg);
}

// ---

function foo(msg: string): never {
  while (true) {}
}
```

## TypeScript configuration

### Watch mode

Use the **`--watch`** mode (or simply `-w`) to watch for TS file changes and compile on save. This saves us some manual work.

```
$ tsc app.ts --watch
```

Any errors are immediately listed on file save.

### Creating a config file

* **`tsc init`** in the project root folder will create a `tsconfig.json` file
* Now, we can run `tsc` or `tsc -w` without specifying the file names and TS will compile all the `.ts` files in the project
* A config file is helpful when we want to manage more than just one `.ts` file i.e When we want to manage a whole TS project

*Default config file*:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    /* Visit https://aka.ms/tsconfig to read more about this file */

    /* Projects */

### Specifying files

We can define which files to include or exclude inside the `tsconfig.json`.

#### Excluding files

We can exclude files with the  **`exclude`**  option. By default,  `node_modules`  is excluded but we can specify an array of other files too.

We can even use wildcards (like  `*`  &  `**`  to match any file and recursive search folders)

```json
{  "exclude": [
    "analytics.ts"
  ]
}
```

#### Including files

`include`  does the opposite of  `exclude`. If we do add it, we must specify everything we wanted inside it else it will not compile (even if those files are not present in an  `exclude`  option). So, it has a higher priority than exclude

Here too, we can use wildcards (Ex:  `*`  &  `**`) to match many files and folders:

```json
{
  "include": [
    "analytics.ts"
  ]
}
```

**Note:**  If we exclude a sub-folder or a folder that is included then that sub-folder is actually  _excluded_!

**Note:**  We can also use  **`files`**  instead of  `include`  but the difference is that we cannot match folders in this but we have to list all the files  _individually_ (not very helpful)!

### More compiler options

1.  `allowJs`: Compiles javaScript files also (if `true`). Not needed unless you want to compile over old js files
    
2.  `checkJs`: Reports errors in javascript files (if `true`) but does not compile it (only checks)
    
3.  `declaration`: It will generate a  `.d.ts`  file with function signatures. Useful while creating libraries that will be used by others (will provide autocomplete and typechecks)
    
4.  `sourceMap`: If `true`, will enable source mapping directly to the source  `.ts`  files in the browser. It also needs to be true while debugging in VSCode
    
5.  `outDir`: Specifies the output directory (By default, it is the project root). Perhaps, create a `dist` folder for this purpose.
    
6.  `rootDir`: Specifies the directory from which to compile all  `.ts`  files. By default, it is the project root. Maybe create a `src` directory for this purpose.
    
7.  `removeComments`: Removes comments from output files (if true). Good optimization / minimization strategy
    
8.  `strict`: Keeps all the strict checks in place (enabled by default). It is a combo of many other checks:
    
    1.  `noImplicitAny`: Cannot have  `any`  type. Must be resolved. Will throw an error (if true)
    2.  `strictNullChecks`: Cannot have values that might possibly be  `null`  3.  `strictBindCallApply`: The bind  `this`  and arguments list must match exactly
    3. `noImpliedThis`: Raise error on 'this' expressions with an implied 'any' type (if true) 5.  `alwaysStrict`: Parse in strict mode and emit "use strict" for each source file (if true)
    4. `"strictBindCallApply"`
    5. `"strictPropertyInitialization"`
    6. `"alwaysStrict"`
    7. `"noImplicitReturns"`: A function must always have a return value. There cannot be conditions inside the function that return a value but the same does not happen in the else case.
    
9.  `noEmitOnError`: If there is any error in any of the processed files, no output is generated (not even those files which don't have errors)
10.  `noUnusedLocals`: Cannot have local variables that do not get used
11.  `noUnusedParameters`: Do not leave parameters unused
    

**`strictNullChecks`**

This rule is useful when you have cases where a particular value could be `null` but it is used assuming that the value exists!

```ts
const button = document.getElementById('button')
button.addEventListener('click', () => {}) // ERROR! button can be null if element wasn't found
```

To override the rule, we can  _append  `!`_  at the end of lines of violation:
```ts
const button = document.getElementById('button')!
button.addEventListener('click', () => {}) // No Error because of !
```

*Alternate fix 1 (ESNext)*:
```ts
const button = document.getElementById('button')
button?.addEventListener('click', () => {})
```

*Alternative fix 2 (Recommended)*: You can also explicitly check for `null` case before using props on a DOM element

```ts
const button = document.getElementById('button')

if (button) {
    button.addEventListener('click', () => {})
}
```

**Fine grained source map control options**:
Additional options include:
* `"sourceRoot"`
* `"mapRoot"`
* `"inlineSourceMap"`
* `"inlineSources"`

**VSCode plugin for TS**

* ESLint (needs configuration)
* Prettier (for formatting)
* Debugger for chrome in VSCode (Enable `sourceMaps` & choose run > start debugging)

## Classes & interfaces

### Creating classes

1. Use the `class` keyword
2. Add fields (properties): `<field>: <type> [= <value>];` (Value is optional - provides an initial value)
3. We can specify a constructor. Annotate the parameters
4. Inside the methods (including constructor), access fields using `this` keyword
5. Object instantiation is like regular JS i.e uses the `new` keyword

```typescript
class Department {
  name: string;

  constructor(n: string) {
    this.name = n
  }
}

const accounting = new Department('Accounting')

console.log(accounting.name) // Accounting
```

### Defining methods

We can use the regular JS syntax for object/class methods. The function params can be type annotated and a return type specified

```typescript
class Department {
  name: string;
  constructor(n: string) {
    this.name = n
  }

  describe() {
    console.log('Dept: ' + this.name);
  }
}

const accounting = new Department('Accounting')

accounting.describe() // Dept: Accounting
```

### Be cautious of `this`

The `this` keyword can change depending on invocation (both in JS & TS). However, if you don't want it to be of any structure *not* of the same class, you can pass a special param `this: <classname>` that restricts the `this` value to have the same structure as the class (*Remember*: it has to be the first parameter)

```typescript
const accounting = new Department('Accounting')
const accountingCopy = { describe: accounting.describe }

accountingCopy.describe() // undefined (Runtime unexpected input)
```

```typescript
// Fix:
class Department {
  // ...
  describe(this: Department) {
    console.log('Dept: ' + this.name);
  }
}

const accounting = new Department('Accounting')
const accountingCopy = { describe: accounting.describe }

accountingCopy.describe() // ERROR IN T.S! 
// accountingCopy DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME STRUCTURE AS accounting
```

If the structure matches the `this` constraint i.e matches the class structure, there won't be an error 

```typescript
const accounting = new Department('Accounting')
const accountingCopy = { name: 'ACC_COPY', describe: accounting.describe }

accountingCopy.describe() // Works (No error)
```

It matches only a subset (additional properties can exist that do not exist on the original class):

```typescript
const accounting = new Department('Accounting')
const accountingCopy = { name: 'ACC_COPY', describe: accounting.describe, extra: 'x' }

accountingCopy.describe() // Still works (No error)
```

### Private & public fields

Access modifiers are appended to the class fields. By default, it is `public` so we don't need to add it

```typescript
// Default: public fields
class Department {
  name: string;
  employees: string[] = []

  constructor(n: string) {
    this.name = n
  }

  addEmployee(this: Department, emp: string) {
    console.log('Adding: ' + this.name);
    this.employees.push(emp)
  }
}

const accounting = new Department('Accounting')
accounting.addEmployee('Max')
accounting.employees.push('Ram') // Not good! We probably shouldn't be able to do this
// But, it is allowed since "employee" is a public field
```

```typescript
// Using private:
class Department {
  name: string;
  private employees: string[] = []

  constructor(n: string) {
    this.name = n
  }

  addEmployee(this: Department, emp: string) {
    console.log('Adding: ' + this.name);
    this.employees.push(emp)
  }
}

const accounting = new Department('Accounting')
accounting.addEmployee('Max')
accounting.employees.push('Ram') // Error! Not allowed to access private props outside class
```

### Shorthand initialiser

Many times we just add constructor params to fields. This is redundant, we can use a shorthand of specifying params with access modifiers and that gets auto-saved into the class as a field (with the same name)

```typescript
class Department {
  // Other fields can still go here...
  constructor(public name: string, private employees: string[] = []) {
  }
  // ...
}
```

The above is equivalent to the following:

```typescript
class Department {
  name: string;
  private employees: string[] = []

  constructor(n: string) {
    this.name = n
  }
  // ...
}
```

### Readonly properties

It is another access modifier. The field is Initialised once but never changed later! 

It can be used along with both public and private access modifiers.

```typescript
class Department {
  private readonly company = 'HP'
  constructor(public name: string, private employees: string[] = []) {
  }

  updateYear() {
    this.company = 'Samsung' // Error! Read only cannot be reinitialised
  }
}
```

Access modifiers help us write *clear and explicit code*!

### Inheritance

When we need more specific blueprints (more than a base class) we use inheritance. In this case, we will have a base/parent class and a child class!

Inheritance:

1. Allows you to share common functionality
2. Create more specialised blueprints

Use the **`extends`** keyword to inherit. We can inherit only *from one class*

The child class:

1. Automatically gets everything in base class! (methods & properties)
2. Constructor of child class needs to invoke **`super`** which is a call to constructor of parent class. Therefore, call it with arguments needed by the parent class constructor. You must call `super` before accessing `this` in the child constructor *(rule!)*
3. Child class can have new propertiess & methods i.e over & above the base class
4. Child class can also *override methods* of base class! 

```typescript
class Department {
  private readonly company = 'HP'
  // 1. Use protected to make properties in base class available 
  // to child class but not outside of it! 
  // It is an in-between modifier: neither private nor public
  constructor(public name: string, protected employees: string[] = []) {
  }

  printInfo() {
    console.log(`${this.name}: ${this.employees}`); 
  }
}

class ITDepartment extends Department { // 2. Use the "extends" keyword
  private admins: string[]; // 3. Child can have new properties of its own

  constructor(name: string, employees: string[] = [], admins: string[]) {
    super(name, employees) // 4. `super` must be called before accessing `this`
    this.admins = admins
  }

  printAdmins() { // 5. Child can have new methods of its own
    console.log(`IT Dept admins: ${this.admins}`);
    
  }

  printInfo() { // 6. Child can override existing base class methods
    // 7. Can access protected base class
    // values internally (within the class)
    console.log(`IT Dept members: ${this.employees}`);
    // 8. Can access its own private class properties internally 
    console.log(`IT Dept admins: ${this.admins}`);
  }
}

const itDept = new ITDepartment('IT', ['Ram', 'Max'], ['Ram'])
itDept.company // Error! cannot access private prop of base class
itDept.name // Can access public class of base class
itDept.printInfo() // Can access and override base class methods
itDept.printAdmins() // Can access its own properties and methods
```

### Protected access modifier

Child classes can use the base class props i.e `public` & `protected` but they cannot access `private` fields of the base class

`public` fields of base class can be accessed internally as well as externally

`private` fields of base class can be accessed only internally

### Getters and setters

Sometimes we want to pre-process or post-process certain field values. Or, maybe we want to be able to read or safely set a private value wihout being able to directly access it.

Use the `get` and `set` methods for thid purpose! `set` method additionally requires a value parameter that is used for setting!

```typescript
class Department {
  private readonly company = 'HP'
  private establishedYear: number = 0

  constructor(public name: string, protected employees: string[] = []) {
  }

  get established() {
    if (this.establishedYear === 0) {
      throw new Error('Does not have it set yet!')
    }
    return this.establishedYear
  }

  set established(value: number) {
    if (value > 1000 && value < 9999) {
      this.establishedYear = value
    }
  }
}

const accounts = new Department('accounts')

// Use it like fields (internally invoked as function)
accounts.established = 2020
console.log(accounts.established); // 2020
```

### Static properties and methods

These are fields and methods defined on a class, not on object instance i.e shared by all objects!

The `static` keyword placed in front of a field or method identifies it!

We must access such methods directly on the class. We cannot use it with `this.<property>` inside a class method (i.e inside an object) 

If you want to use it, use `<classname>.<prop>`

They work as namespaces!

```typescript
class Department {
  constructor(public name: string, protected employees: string[] = []) {}

  static company = 'HP' // Use the static keyword

  printCompany() {
    console.log(`Company: ${Department.company}`); // Cannot use `this` but class name
  }
}

const accounts = new Department('accounts')

console.log(Department.company) // HP
accounts.printCompany(); // Company: HP
```

**Note:** Inside a static method, `this` refers to the class itself (and not the object). But, just for clarity, you can use the class name instead!

### Abstract classes

Sometimes, we may have classes that are very basic and the implementation depends on a more specialised case.

We can have an abstract class with certain or all methods to be abstract. These force a child class to implement a certain method/property whereas the parent class has only a signature

Abstract class methods are mentioned in parent class but implemented it in child class

Syntax: 

1. `abstract class` on the class signature
2. `abstract <method signature>;`

**Note:** An abstract class can have normal properies and methods too (i.e with implementation)

Use the `extends` keyword, like in regular inheritance, to extend an abstract class.

An abstract method or property has to be *mandatorily* implemented in a child class (only signature is present in parent)

```typescript
abstract class Car {
  // abstract fields:
  abstract name: string;

  // Abstract methods:
  abstract turn(): void;

  // Normal methods:
  info() {
    console.log('A car')
  }
}

class BMW extends Car {
  name: string;
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.name = 'bmw'
  }

  turn() {
    console.log('Turning the BMW');
  }
}

const bmw = new BMW()
bmw.turn() // implemented the abstract method
bmw.info() // Can still access non-abstract methods of parent class
```

### Singletons

Singleton is a common and useful pattern that is used when you want to have exactly one object instance based on a class. Reinitialisation is not possible; we can only use the already instantiated object (first time).

**Singleton pattern in Typescript:**

1. Create a *private constructor* method
2. Create a *static* method to:
   1. Invoke the private constructor
   2. Save the new object into a *private static* field (**Note:** The type is of the class itself)
3. On subsequent instantiation attempts, return the already instantiated object!

Use the class static method to fetch the singleton instance (and not the `new` keyword) outside the class

```typescript
class Config {
  private static instance: Config;
  private constructor(private configName: string) {}

  static getInstance(name: string) {
    // `this` refers to class in a static method (not object)
    if (this.instance) { // Can also use `Config.instance` 
      return this.instance;
    }
    this.instance = new this(name)
    return this.instance
  }

  printConfigName() {
    console.log(this.configName); 
  }
}

const singletonConfig = Config.getInstance('Junu')
const singletonConfig2 = Config.getInstance('Junu2')

console.log(singletonConfig === singletonConfig2); // true
singletonConfig.printConfigName() // Junu
singletonConfig2.printConfigName() // Junu
```

### Interfaces

An interface is like a custom `type`. But, it only defines a *structure of an object*. It can be used to enforce contracts that classes (or objects or functions) should follow.

Therefore, interfaces are just ***contracts*** that a class and the third party accessor of the object adhere to!

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  getAge: () => number;
}
```

Use the **`implements`** keyword make a class implement an interface i.e have all the properties & methods an interface has!

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  getAge: () => number;
}

class Employee implements Person {
  constructor(public name: string, public age: number) {}

  getAge() {
    return this.age
  }
}
```

We can implement from ***multiple*** interfaces. That is because, *multiple interfaces get merged when implemented together in a class giving rise to one single object structure that must be followed*.

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  getAge: () => number;
}

interface Greets {
  hi: () => void,
  bye: () => void,
  greetWithMessage: (msg: string) => void
}

class Employee implements Person, Greets {
  constructor(public name: string, public age: number) {}
  
  hi() {
    console.log('Hi bro');
  }
  
  bye() {
    console.log('bye bro');
  }
  
  greetWithMessage(msg: string) {
    console.log(msg);
  }

  getAge() {
    return this.age
  }
}
```

#### Readonly interface properties

We cannot have *access modifiers* except for **`readonly`**. That is because, private fields cannot be in an interface since it defines the structure of an object from the perspective of external access

```typescript
interface Person {
  readonly name: string; // This means that name can only be intialised once in the class
  age: number;
  getAge: () => number;
}
```

#### Extending interfaces

Instead of implementing multiple interfaces, we can also extend interfaces from one another. This is similar to reusing interfaces when building more complex ones. For example, we can be using a `Person` in one place but a `GreetingPerson` in another place. A greeting person is also a person so the interface can be extended

Use the `extends` keyword (similar to classes)

```typescript
interface Person {
  readonly name: string;
  age: number;
  getAge: () => number;
}

interface GreetingPerson extends Person {
  hi: () => void,
  bye: () => void,
  greetWithMessage: (msg: string) => void
}

class Employee implements GreetingPerson { /* ... */ }
```

We can extend ***multiple*** interfaces too! Use commas (`,`). It is similar to using intersection on multiple object types

```typescript
interface GreetingPerson extends Person, Animal { /* ... */ }
```

#### Optional properties in interfaces

You can use the **`?`** operator to specifying optional properties. 

**Note:** The class implementing the interface can also implement it as a mandatory or optional properties. The logic must be written accordingly

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age?: number;
  getAge: () => number;
}

class Employee implements Person {
  age?: number;
  constructor(public name: string, age: number) {
    if (age) {
      this.age = age
    } 
  }

  getAge() {
    if (this.age) {
      return this.age
    }
    return 0
  }
}
```

#### Interfaces vs custom types

- `type` defines a custom type. It can be any type. Interfaces always define an object structure
- `type` can also be of any type (flexible): It can have unions. Interfaces are only objects
- Interfaces are implemented by classes but they cannot implement a `type`

#### Interfaces vs abstract classes

* Abstract classes can have both abstract properties and methods as well as normal ones with implementations. Interfaces only have signatures and no implementation
* We can only extend one abstract class (or regular classes). We can implement many interfaces because these interface structures get merged into one single object structure that the class needs to implement
* Interfaces are for **contracts**. It is not just for the class. It is for both:
  * (1) The developer of an object
  * (2) The user of an object (3rd party)
  * The implementer and the user need only implement a common structure i.e a contract using interfaces so that they can stay decoupled with a clear API. This is the purpose of an interface. It does not matter which class was used to create an object i.e implementation does not matter (clean code)

#### Interfaces as function types

Apart from objects, we can also define *contracts for functions* using interfaces. Sometimes it is helpful to know the structure of functions too especially anonymous functions (ex: callbacks)

In this case, the interface can be used as a ***type annotation*** for a function

The interface itself must contain one function signature (use `:` and not an arrow function) within the object syntax like below:

```typescript
interface binaryNumericOperator {
  (n1: number, n2: number): number; // Use `:` and not an arrow function
}

const add: binaryNumericOperator = (n1, n2) => n1 + n2
console.log(add(1, 2)); // 3
```

#### Interfaces do not get compiled into Javascript

Interfaces are purely for compilation. Violations are caught during compilation. But, the code does not need to be there as a data structure in generated Javascript. It is removed before generation

## Advanced types

### Intersection type

Use the `&` operator to combine two types. 

```typescript
type employee = {
  name: string;
}

type admin = {
  isAdmin: boolean
}

type adminEmployee = employee & admin // It is both an admin and an employee

function createAdmin(name: string): adminEmployee {
  return {
    name,
    isAdmin: true
  }
}

console.log(createAdmin('Pushkar'));
```

```typescript
type StrNum = string | number
type NumBool = number | boolean

type intersection = StrNum & NumBool // TYPE: number

type union = StrNum | NumBool // TYPE: string | number | boolean
```

The other type is **Union `|`** which is *this or that*

### Type guards

It is a construct used to know which type we are actually getting before an operation can be carried out. This is useful when we need to make sure we don't carry out an erroneous operation i.e where the operands are not of the type we want them to be!

#### `typeof`

This is one type guard that exists in vanilla JS itself

```typescript
type StrNum = string | number

function addNums(n1: StrNum, n2: StrNum) {
  if (typeof n1 === "string" || typeof n2 === "string") { // TYPE GUARD
    return 'Can only add numbers'
  }
  return n1 + n2
}
```

#### `in`

This is another construct that checks for existence of a property in an object. Available in regular JS itself and can be used inside an `if` block

```typescript
type employee = {
  name: string;
}

type admin = {
  isAdmin: boolean;
  privileges: string[]
}

type unknownEmployee = employee | admin

function printPrivileges(emp: unknownEmployee) {
  if ("privileges" in emp) {
    console.log('Privileges:', emp.privileges);
  }
  return 'None'
}

console.log(printPrivileges({ name: 'Pushkar' })); // "None"
```

#### `instanceof`

This is an operator that tells us if something is an instance of a class

```typescript
class Car {
  drive() {
    console.log('driving...');
  }
}

class Truck extends Car {
  loadCargo() {
    console.log('loading cargo...');
  }
}

type Vehicle = Car | Truck

function performAllVehicleActions(v: Vehicle) {
  if (v instanceof Car) {
    v.drive()
  }
  if (v instanceof Truck) {
    v.loadCargo()
  }
}

performAllVehicleActions(new Truck())

/*
driving...
loading cargo...
*/
```

You cannot use `instanceof` on interfaces because it does not exist for them

#### Discrimated unions

It is a very useful pattern when dealing with interfaces and objects. 

1. We cannot use `instanceof` because interfaces do not have them
2. We cannot use typeof because the interface is not a primitive data type
3. We can use `in` but if there are too many differing properties between interfaces, it leads to a lot of checks

***Solution***: Keep one property inside the interface that uniquely describes it and use that in a switch case to discriminate and perform separate actions accordingly

```typescript
interface Bird {
  type: 'bird'; // A literal type to identify interface uniquely
  flyingSpeed: number
}

interface Horse {
  type: 'horse'; // A literal type to identify interface uniquely
  runningSpeed: number // It cannot fly!
}

type Animal = Bird | Horse

function moveAnimal(a: Animal) {
  let speed
  switch (a.type) {
    case 'bird':
      speed = a.flyingSpeed
      break;
    case 'horse':
      speed = a.runningSpeed
      break;
  }
}
```

### Type casting

When TS is not sure about a type, we can assure TS by specifying a type. This is helpful in cases where we fetch DOM elements but TS cannot determine its exact type

Use angle brackets **`<>`** or the **`as`** keyword to typecast. The most common use case is to transform `HTMLElement` to a more specific type of element like `HTMLInputElement`

Sometimes we need to account for possible `null` values (Ex: Such as a non-existent DOM element). In order to assure TS that the value will not be null, we can use **`!`** operator before typecasting it

```typescript
const $username = document.getElementById('username')
$username.value // ERROR!
// Object is possibly null (&) 
// Property does not exist on value type HTMLElement
```

```typescript
// One way to typecast:
const $username = <HTMLInputElement>document.getElementById('username')!
$username.value
```

In react, the above way of typecasting will conflict with JSX syntax. Therefore use an alternate syntax:

```typescript
// React (JSX) friendly typecast:
const $username = document.getElementById('username')! as HTMLInputElement
$username.value
```

When we want to typecast *on the fly*:

```typescript
const $username = document.getElementById('username')

if ($username) { // Alternative to null override (!)
  // Typecast can only be done after assuring TS of a non-null value
  ($username as HTMLInputElement).value
}
```

```typescript
// Other examples:
value as string
value as (string | number)
values as { name: string, age: number }
```

### Property index

When declaring interfaces, we might want to be more generic in defining the properties and the types. For this we can use the bracket notation `[]` to define a property type and follow it up with a value type

This is useful when we know the type of property we can expect but not the exact names. For example, anyone of the fields (email, password, username) might be incorrectly entered and we need to show an error message with the field that was incorrect. But, we don't know till the error occurs as to which of the fields had an error

```typescript
interface ErrorContainer {
  [prop: string]: string
}
// Because we used a property index,
// we cannot have something other than the type of the property 
// For example, we cannot have `id: number`
// but we can have `id: string` (matches property index type)
// This is a restriction!

const errorBag: ErrorContainer = {
  email: 'Email is wrong',
  password: 'Password is wrong',
  username: 'Username is wrong'
}
```

### Function overloads

Whenever we want to be *more specific about the return types* of a function based on input parameters, we can add additional signatures for a function just above its definition

Assume that you have an add function and you want to concatenate two strings and split it later. TS will throw an error when you use `split()` because it is not sure whether the returned type is a string or a number. The following example presents this problem:

```typescript
type NumStr = number | string

function add(n1: NumStr, n2: NumStr) {
  if (typeof n1 === 'string' || typeof n2 === 'string') {
    return `${n1}${n2}`
  }
  return n1 + n2
}

const concatedNames = add('Pushkar', 'DK')
concatedNames.split('') // ERROR! 
// The split() method is only available on strings
// But TS knows that the return type of add()
// can be either a string or a number - hence throws an error!
```

We can fix this with function overloading. That is, specify that if it is a string return only a string! We can also cover the other cases. Shown below:

```typescript
type NumStr = number | string

// Function overloading with a more signature above definition
// There can be multiple overloads above the definition
function add(n1: string, n2: string): string;
function add(n1: number, n2: string): string;
function add(n1: string, n2: number): string;
function add(n1: number, n2: number): number;
function add(n1: NumStr, n2: NumStr) {
  if (typeof n1 === 'string' || typeof n2 === 'string') {
    return `${n1}${n2}`
  }
  return n1 + n2
}

const concatedNames = add('Pushkar', 'DK')
concatedNames.split('') // Works!
```

### Optional chaining

We can use optional chaining to fetch object properties (esp. nested) that may or may not exist. It will return `undefined` if it cannot fetch it but there is no runtime error

```typescript
const response = {
  userId: 10,
  meta: {
    description: {
      name: 'Pushkar',
      age: 27
    }
  }
}

response?.meta?.description?.name // "Pushkar"

// What if the response does not contain height
// Since response comes at runtime, TS cannot know for sure
// but optional chaining helps with it:
response?.meta?.description?.height // undefined (BUT no error!)
```

TS has optional chaining since v3.7 and JS has it in ES2020+.

### Nullish coalescing

When we use `||` operator in JS, we skip the falsy values and choose a default

```typescript
'' || 'default' // default
0 || 'default' // default
false || 'default' // default
undefined || 'default' // default
null || 'default' // default
```

This is fine but what if we wanted to keep the empty string or a 0 value? For this, TS (and newer standards of JS) provides an alternate operator **`??`** that ***only skips `null` and `undefined`***

```typescript
'' ?? 'default' // ''
0 ?? 'default' // 0
false ?? 'default' // false
undefined ?? 'default' // default
null ?? 'default' // default
```

## Generic types

Generic types provides flexible and reusable code. They help with *additional type infromation* you can use when you have a complex class or a function

We can build generic functions and classes. They also have some constraints

Usually, *generics are attached to another type and mentioned within angled brackets **`<>`***

```typescript
const arr: string[] = ['Hi', 'Hello', 'bye'] // STRING type attached to array type
```

The above snippet can be written as a generic as shown below:

```typescript
const arr: Array<string> = ['Hi', 'Hello', 'bye']
```

We can have combined types too:

```typescript
const arr: Array<string | number> = ['Hi', 1, 'Hello', 2, 'bye']
```

Another example where it is useful is in **promises**. More often than not, TS does not know the type of the resolution of a promise. It falls back to type `any`. We can change this by adding a generic type to the promise resolution data so that TS can identify it and provide autocompletion and typechecks

```typescript
const promise: Promise<string> = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve('Resolved string')
  }, 1000)
})

promise.then(data => {
  data.split() // Works!
})
```

### Generic functions

```typescript
function mergeObj(o1: object, o2: object) {
  return Object.assign(o1, o2)
}

const merged = mergeObj({
  name: 'Pushkar'
}, {
  age: 27
})

merged.name // ERROR! 
// Because TS inferred return type to be an object
// But, object type is very generic (useless)
// it does not recognise properties
```

The above piece does not provide the type of a merged object like we expected. Therefore, we can customize our functions by providing generics so that we may deal with different types of data & expect a more customized return type.

```typescript
// Using generic types to get an intersection of types for return:
function mergeObj<T, U>(o1: T, o2: U) {
  return Object.assign(o1, o2)
} // RETURN TYPE: T & U

const merged = mergeObj({
  name: 'Pushkar'
}, {
  age: 27
})

merged.name // NO ERROR!
```

#### Generic types can be extended from other types

```typescript
function mergeObj<T extends object, U extends object>(o1: T, o2: U) {
  return Object.assign(o1, o2)
} // RETURN TYPE: T & U

```

Multiple extensions are also possible:

```typescript
function add<T extends string | number, U extends string | number>(a: T, b: U) {}
```

Extending generic types from existing ones allows us to ***add constraints on the generic types***

An example of using an interface to add a constraint *(Constraint: Must have a length property)*:

```typescript
// The problem with the below snippet is that it restricts to strings & arrays;
function countAndDescribe(n: string | any[]) {
  return "Length is:" + n.length
}

// The fix (with interface and extending a generic type):
interface Lengthy {
  length: number
}

function countAndDescribe<T extends Lengthy>(n: T) {
  return "Length is:" + n.length
}
```

#### The `keyof` operator for generic types

This operator is used to assure TS that the generic type is a property of an object. TS then knows that it has to expect a property of an object (tighter control):

```typescript
// The problem:
function displayPropValue<T extends object, U>(o: T, p: U) {
  console.log(o[p]); // ERROR! TS cannot guarantee that p is a key of object o  
}

// The solution:
function displayPropValue<T extends object, U extends keyof T>(o: T, p: U) {
  console.log(o[p]); // No error
}

displayPropValue({ name: 'Push' }, 'name') // No error
displayPropValue({ name: 'DK' }, 'age') // TS catches errors if property is not passed
```

### Generic classes

We can use generic types to create a class that is flexible. Imagine a storage class that can store different types of data. The type of the data can be resolved based on usage!

```typescript
// Contrived example:
class DataStorage<T> {
  private items: T[] = [];

  setItem(item: T) {
    this.items.push(item)
  }

  removeItem(item: T) {
    this.items.splice(this.items.indexOf(item), 1)
  }

  getItems() {
    return [...this.items]
  }
}

const textStorage = new DataStorage<string>()
textStorage.setItem('item')
textStorage.getItems()
textStorage.removeItem('item')

const numberStorage = new DataStorage<number>()
numberStorage.setItem(100)
numberStorage.getItems()
numberStorage.removeItem(100)
```

Therefore, *functions and classes can be constructed from generic types*

###Generic utility types

1. **`Partial`** is a type of generic that allows us to partially build objects. The object type itself might contain more properties but it takes times to build it! Once we have build it completely we can typecast to the full time in the end

   ```typescript
   interface User {
     name: string;
     age: number,
     id: number
   }
   
   function createUser(name: string, age: number, curId: number) {
     let user: Partial<User> = {}
     // Sometimes, you might need to build an object gradually
     user.name = name
     user.age = age
     user.id = curId + 1
     return user as User // Finally, typecast it back
   }
   
   createUser('Pushkar', 27, 122)
   ```

2. **`Readonly`** is another type of generic that ensures the value creates is read only i.e initialised once without reassignment! Basically, it creates a readonly tuple (It is similar to access modifier `readonly` in classes but with an attached generic type)

   ```typescript
   const admins: Readonly<string[]> = ['Ram', 'Laxman']
   
   admins.push('Balaram') // Error! (as expected)
   ```

Generic types are *more powerful* than unions. Unions need more code to define and less flexible.

## Decorators

It is an experimental feature. Currently, a part of the ES7 spec and not widely supported yet in vanilla JS.

Decorators are used for **meta-programming** (Extra functionality behind the scenes)

It needs to be enabled by enabling the following in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": true /* Enables experimental support for ES7 decorators. */
  }
}
```

Decorators perform pre & post processing on a ***function invocation or a class creation***. It also provides us valuable information about our code itself! We can carry out additional tasks whenever a function runs or a class is defined!

*Syntax*: Use **`@`** and decorator function name on top of a class or a function

### Class decorators

These decorators are functions that execute **when a class is defined** *(Note: They do not execute when an object is instantiated)*. They receive the **constructor** function of the class as a parameter

```typescript
function Logger(constructor: Function) { // Convention for decorators: capitalized!
  console.log('Logging...');
}

@Logger
class Person {
  constructor(private name: string) {}

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} speaking`);
  }
}

const pushkar = new Person('Pushkar')
pushkar.speak()

/* Output:
Logging...
Pushkar speaking
*/
```

#### Multiple decorators

Multiple decorators can be defined one above the other on top of a class or a function. They are executed in the **bottom-to-top** order (but, they are registered in top-to-bottom order):

```typescript
function Logger(constructor: Function) {
  console.log('Logging...');
}

function Analytics(constructor: Function) {
  console.log('Sending analytics...');
}

@Logger
@Analytics
class Person {
  constructor(private name: string) {}

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} speaking`);
  }
}

const pushkar = new Person('Pushkar')
pushkar.speak()

/* Output:
Sending analytics...
Logging...
Pushkar speaking
*/
```

#### Decorator factories

We can have a ***higher-order function*** that returns a decorator function based on properties (customisable). Therefore, it acts as a factory that selects which decorator to deliver. It is a commonly used pattern since it gives us more flexibility.

**Note:** Decorators are registered first, in top-to-bottom fashion but they are executed for a class definition in a bottom-to-top order

```typescript
function Logger(name: string) {
  console.log('Logger factory');
  return (constructor: Function) => {
    console.log(`${name} | Logging...`);
  }
}

function Analytics(name: string) {
  console.log('Analytics factory');
  return (constructor: Function) => { // Not using param? Replace with `_` to ignore errors
    console.log(`${name} | Sending analytics...`);
  }
}


@Logger('User')
@Analytics('User')
class Person {
  constructor(private name: string) {}

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} speaking`);
  }
}

const pushkar = new Person('Pushkar')
pushkar.speak()

/* Output:
Logger factory
Analytics factory
User | Sending analytics...
User | Logging...
Pushkar speaking
*/
```

#### Property decorators

They are defined for instance or static properties. 

* If instance, the target is the prototype object
* If static, the target is a constructor function

```typescript
function Log(target: any, propertyName: string | Symbol) {
  console.log(target, propertyName);
}

class Person {
  @Log
  private name: string

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name
  }
}

/* Output:
{constructor: Æ’} "name"
*/
```

#### Accessor decorators

These are for accessors i.e `get` & `set` methods. It has a third parameter: *Property descriptor* of the accessor method

```typescript
function Log(target: any, propertyName: string | Symbol, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  console.log(target, propertyName, descriptor);
}

class Person {
  private _name: string

  constructor(name: string) {
    this._name = name
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name
  }

  @Log
  set name(value: string) {
    this._name = value
  }
}

/* Output:
{constructor: Æ’} "name" {enumerable: false, configurable: true, get: Æ’, set: Æ’}
*/
```

#### Method decorators

Class methods can also have decorators. The parameters are similar to accessor decorators

```typescript
function Log(target: any, propertyName: string | Symbol, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  console.log(target, propertyName, descriptor);
}
class Person {
  private _name: string

  constructor(name: string) {
    this._name = name
  }

  @Log
  printName() {
    console.log(this._name);
  }
}

/* Output:
{constructor: Æ’, printName: Æ’} "printName" {writable: true, enumerable: false, configurable: true, value: Æ’}
*/
```

#### Parameter decorators

Not only class methods, but even their parameters can be decorated. Place the decorator syntax just before the parameter in the argument list.

The arguments of the parameter decorator are similar to method ones except that instead of a property descriptor, we get the *position* of the parameter in the arguments list

```typescript
function Log(target: any, propertyName: string | Symbol, position: number) {
  console.log(target, propertyName, position);
}
class Person {
  private _name: string

  constructor(name: string) {
    this._name = name
  }

  printNameWithMessage(@Log message: string) {
    console.log(`${this._name}: ${message}`);
  }
}

/* Output:
{constructor: Æ’, printNameWithMessage: Æ’} "printNameWithMessage" 0
*/
```

**Note:** Decorators execute during definitions (not during method runs or instantiations i.e *not at runtime*). However, we can *return* values from it depending on the kind of decorator it is in order to provide runtime functionality.

#### Enhancing class constructors using decorators

Class decorators can return a new constructor function that executes after the actual constructor function when an object is instantiated. Therefore, it changes the class to execute the original constructor function as well as the newly returned one

It uses syntactic sugar to make it look like the original constructor is being extended by the returned constructor (similar to a class)

```typescript
function OutputFieldsToContainer(originalConstructor: Function) {
  return class extends originalConstructor { // ERROR!
    // Error because we cannot extend a "Function" or "any" type (originalConstructor)
  }
}

// Solution: Define a generic type for the constructor function
// Allow it to take any args of any type (customisation is up to you)
// Let it return the type that matches the structure of the objects of the class
```

The fix (Generic type for constructor):

```typescript
<T extends { new (...args: any[]): { name: string } }>
// This is how you define a constructor function as a type
// i.e Syntax is as folows:
// (1) Object with the (2) new keyword and a 
// (3) function signature with (4) return type
```

Full solution:

```typescript
function OutputFieldsToContainer<T extends { new (...args: any[]): { name: string } }>(originalConstructor: T) {
  console.log('Decorator');
  
  return class extends originalConstructor {
    constructor(...args: any[]) { // (1) Not using params? Prefix with `_` to avoid TS errors!
      super(...args) // (2) We must call this so that original constructor is called!
      const $container = document.getElementById('name')!
      $container.innerHTML = this.name // (3) `this` will refer to original class in this case
    }
  }
}

@OutputFieldsToContainer
class Person {
  name: string

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name
  }
}

const pushkar = new Person('pushkar')

/* Console output: Decorator */
/* HTML (#name div) output: pushkar */
```

#### Enhancing methods & accessors using decorators

A modified property descriptor can be returned so that the method or accessor method can be modified. A useful example of this is when you "auto-bind" the `this` keyword to the class while invoking the method!

```typescript
function Autobind(_: any, _2: string | Symbol, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  // `_` prefixed parameters are ignored by TS compiler during "unused" check
  const originalMethod = descriptor.value // (1) The method itself is available here
  return {
    configurable: true,
    enumerable: false,
    get() { // (2) This method gets invoked before any method or property access
      // (3) The `this` is the class (or prototype?) inside the get() descriptor
      return originalMethod.bind(this)
    }
  }
}

class Person {
  constructor(public name: string) {}

  @Autobind
  printName() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}

const pushkar = new Person('pushkar')
const $button = document.getElementById('button')!

$button.addEventListener('click', pushkar.printName) 
// Without Autobinding (or binding manually to the class),
// `undefined` would have been printed on button click
// Now, it prints "pushkar"
```

#### Validating data using decorators

`[TO BE DONE]`

**Note:** Instead of writing our own, we can use easily available 3rd party decorators. **`typestack/class-validator`** is a popular open source decorator library that helps us validates classes & its fields

This approach might be better than writing your own validator decorators for **production code**

## Namespaces

Using namespaces code syntax, we can "group code".

Per-file or bundled compilation is possible (less imports to manage)

**Namespaces are similar to ES6 imports and exports**. Both provide similar functionality.

We can wrap all the pieces of code that need to be grouped together into a `namespace`:

```tsx
namespace DragableInterfaces {
  // All TS code under "DragableInterfaces" namespace should go here!
  interface dragable {
    dragStarted(event: DragEvent): void;
    dragEnded(event: DragEvent): void;
  }
  // ...
  // ...
}
```

We can expose parts of the interface outside of it by using the `exports` keyword

```tsx
namespace DragableInterfaces {
  // All TS code under "DragableInterfaces" namespace should go here!
  export interface dragable {
    dragStarted(event: DragEvent): void;
    dragEnded(event: DragEvent): void;
  }
  // ...
  // ...
}
```

Use the `export` keyword (just like in ES6 modules) in order to expose a method or property from a namepsace (While keeping the rest of it inaccessible from the outside world)

### Requiring a namespace

We cannot use elements of a namspace without first requiring a reference to it first.

```ts
/// <reference path="./path/to/file/containing/a/namspace/definition">
```

The prefix `///` is mandatory. It tells TS that you are importing a reference to a namespace

Namespaces are fine but not perfect. We still need to manually add all dependencies which is tedious!

## Modules

Instead of namepaces, we can use the regular **ES6 modules** (i.e `import` and `export ` syntax) and it works just fine (given that we use transpilers like babel and bundlers like webpack to take care of the resulting JS)

**Note:** `outFile` config in `.tsconfig` is not supported with ES modules so you need to comment that out!

***USE ES MODULES OVER NAMESPACES (RECOMMENDED)***

## Webpack with Typescript

We require **`typescript`** & **`ts-loader`** npm packages

Additionally, `webpack`, `webpack-cli` and `webpack-dev-server` are also needed for webpack itself

We don't need a `rootDir` config in TS since webpack takes care of source files to compile

Remove extensions `.js` and `.ts` from imports since webpack will automatically search for the files wihout their extensions

Webpack config:

1. Mark entry point to be your first entry file (Ex: `./src/app.ts`)
2. Output must contain a filename for the bundle and a file path (output directory)
3. Use `ts-loader` to add a loader to `.ts` files to process them! (Inside `module.rules`)
4. Use `resolve` to tell webpack to look out for both extensions, `.ts` and `.js`
5. *Optional*: set `sourceMap` in tsconfig to `true` so as to debug `.ts` files when app runs
   1. Can also set `devtool` property in webpack for type of source mapping
6. Create a build script like `"build": "webpack",` in package.json (`npm run build`)

```js
// webpack.config.js
const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/app.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.ts$/,
        use: 'ts-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      },
    ],
  },
  devtool: 'inline-source-map',
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.ts', '.js'],
  },
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "understanding-typescript",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Understanding TypeScript Course Setup",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "lite-server",
    "build": "webpack"
  }
}
```

Webpack dev server will serve files from memory instead of the file system `dist` folder. For everything to run correctly in dev server, set a `publicPath` to `dist` (i.e your output folder) for everything to run correctly!

```js
// Package.json:
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack-dev-server",
  }
}
```

```js
// webpack.config.js:
const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/app.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    publicPath: 'dist',
  },
  //...
}
```

## Typescript and 3rd party libraries

Not all 3rd party libraries are built using typescript!

When you import these libs into your typescript project, TS will throw errors. And, if `noEmitOnError` is `true`, it won't even compile the code.

```ts
// app.ts
import _ from 'lodash' // TS ERROR!! Could not find a declaration file for module 'lodash'

console.log(_.shuffle([1, 2, 3]))
```

What can we do? We can **import types for a library if they are made available**

If you are using a 3rd party library that does not have types defined, you can:

1. Install the types for it (Any popular 3rd party library will have types)
2. The naming convention for the package's type is **`@types/<package>`**
3. You only need to install it as a dev dependency (since it is only for TS which compiles the code)
4. *Automatic*: You don't have to import the types package into your project (just installation is enough for TS to search for it)

About `@types`:

1. The @types packages contain no logic. Only signatures for their APIs which act like instructions to TS
2. They are having the **`.d.ts`** extension which tells TS that they are "declaration" files
3. The benefits includes autocompletion in vscode, errors on type mismatch, etc.

```shell
npm i -D @types/lodash
```

```ts
// app.ts
import _ from 'lodash' // NO ERROR (TYPE WAS READ FROM `@types/lodash`)

console.log(_.shuffle([1, 2, 3]))
```

You can find the type libraries for most popular libraries at this repo called [definitely typed](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)

### Use `declare` as a last resort

When we have some values outside of the TS world and it's not a library either then its usage inside your TS project will make TS throw an error. TS simply does not know what it is and if it exists

This can happen when we are using some global variables that are defined elsewhere (like on the window object) but TS has no way of knowing it. Because it is not a library, we cannot include the types for it

In such a scenario, we can use `declare` followed by the type for that variable before its usage.

```html
<!-- SOME HTML -->
<script>
var GLOBAL = 'GLOBAL'
</script>
```

```ts
// app.ts:
console.log(GLOBAL); // ERROR! TS DOES NOT KNOW ABOUT "GLOBAL" AND ITS TYPE
```

The fix with `declare`:

```ts
// app.ts
declare var GLOBAL: any
console.log(GLOBAL); // NO ERROR!
```

Use `declare` sparingly! It is better to use it as a *last-resort measure* (when you cannot have a declaration file or convert the code into TS)

## Typescript with React

- A functional component is a function that receives props & returns JSX. Its type in TS is **`React.FC`**
- A class component is a class that has a render method returning JSX. Its type in TS is **`React.ClassicComponent`**. You don't have to specify this type for a class though

**Note:** We can have *interfaces* for our props (and state) and supply them as generics to our components!

We can rename our component file extensions to **`.ts`** or **`.tsx`**

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">Example</div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

```tsx
//  CLASS COMPONENT EXAMPLE:
import React from 'react';

class Comp extends React.Component<Props, State> {
  render() {
    return (
    <div className="App">Example</div>
  	);
  }
} 
```

### Types for props

We need to install **`@types/react` & `@types/react-dom`** for the types

If you use props, you must tell TS about the types of props being used. The approach is to 

*1. Create an interface for the props* and 

*2. Add that as a generic type to the component*

```tsx
interface TodoListProps { // You can also use a "type" instead of an interface
  items: {id: string, text: string}[];
};

const TodoList: React.FC<TodoListProps> = props => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {props.items.map(todo => (
        <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
```

```tsx
//  CLASS COMPONENT EXAMPLE:
import React from 'react';

interface Props { /* ... */ }
interface State { /* ... */ }

class Comp extends React.Component<Props, State> {
  /* ... */
}
```

### Types for events

1. Event handlers of React elements receive the `event` argument which has a type `event: React.FormEvent`
2. DOM elements can be types that they represent (i.e DOM element is what is present in` event.target`). Ex: `HTMLElement`, `HTMLDivElement`, `HTMLInputElement`, `HTMLVideoElement`, etc

### Types for hooks

Hooks are functions too and they usually take in a generic type. 

We can define the generic types inside angled brackets. Here is an example:

```tsx
const myRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)
```

An example with `useState`:

```tsx
const myRef = useState<{id: string, name: string}[]>([])
```

**Tip:** Hover over the hook functions in VSCode to understand the types of those functions and what arguments they need!

For the complete guide & cheatsheet for using TS with React, refer to **[this repo](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react)**

Add support for a 3rd part library by searching for its `@types/<libraryname>` package (if it is available)

## Typescript with Node & Express

**Does TS run on Node by default?**

*Yes and No!*

- If the file is `.ts` but contains only JavaScript code, node can execute it 
- If the file is `.ts` but containsTypeScript code, node *cannot* execute it!

**Logic?** Node does not care about the extension of the file (i.e `.ts` or `.js` does not matter). It only cares if the file can be interepreted as Javascript (i.e NodeJS) code!

```ts
// app.ts:
console.log('Hi'); // RUNS with `node app.ts`
```

```ts
// app.ts:
function add(a: number, b: number) { return a + b }
console.log(add(4, 7)); 
/* ERROR!! Does not run with `node app.ts` (X) */
```

### `ts-node` package

This package can be downloaded and installed globally. Use it similar to the way in which you use node (Ex: `ts-node app.ts`) and it will do the compilation of TS to JS behind the scenes and execute the resultant JS code in node

- This is good for local development purposes
- However, when you need production code on a server to execute, having to use this package to compile the files everytime and run the JS on node is an additional overhead and an added dependency (*Not recommended for production environments like servers*)

### TS for production Node project

**Step 1:**

Change **`"moduleResolution"`** to **`"node"`** in `.tsconfig`

**Step 2:**

Install **`@types/node`** as a dev dependency to work with all the types that we need in Node (Ex: `require` needs this package for TS to not throw an error)

**Step 3:**

If using `express` to build a Node server, install **`@types/express`** 

*Note*: Once we install the above types, we can use ES6 import over Node' commonjs imports! (Ex: `import express from 'express`). TS compiler converts it into commonjs (i.e `require` & `module.exports` statements)

**Step 4:**

Create a script that runs the TS compiler by taking source TS files and generating output JS files, in a different (distribution/build) folder (Ex: from `src` to `dist`)

**Step 5:**

Create a script that starts a server (or a development server) by running the generated javascript file from the distribution folder (Ex: `nodemon dist/app.js` and **not** `nodemon src/app.ts`!)

**That's it!**... also check out `nestjs` which helps us write server side code which embraces TS...

**Note**: Types for express middleware

1. Error object: `Error`
2. Request object: `express.Request`
3. Response: ``express.Response`
4. Next callback: ``express.NextFunction`

```ts
app.use((req: express.Request, res: express.Response, next: express.NextFunction) => {
  /* ... */
  next()
})
```
